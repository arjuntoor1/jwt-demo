# JWT Demo Project

## Simple start

1. Run the project in IntelliJ
2. Use tests.http to experiment with the endpoints

## Resources
These were the resources I used to gain a baseline understanding of how Spring does JWT & auth in general. 

- [@DanVega on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DanVega). This guy is legendary, excellent video tutorials. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYNR5js2cXE) is the video I used to start with.
- [Spring Security docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/). Well worth a read, particularly the [architecture](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/architecture.html) section
- [Quick overview of JWT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q17ubqLfaM&pp=ygULd2hhdCBpcyBqd3Q%3D). Basic refresher.
